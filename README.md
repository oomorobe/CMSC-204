# CMSC-204 Computer Science II Coursework: Data Structures
**Montgomery College â€“ Department of Computer Science**

## Course Overview
CMSC 204 builds on concepts introduced in CMSC 203 , emphasizing writing larger programs and designing and implementing classical abstract data types such as list, stack, queue, binary search tree, graph, priority queue, hash table. Topics include string processing and recursion; data abstraction, encapsulation, and structure implementation; object-oriented program design; specification, implementation and application of these traditional ADTs. The course also emphasizes dynamic memory allocation, search and sorting algorithms, and introduces algorithm complexity. Designing and implementing advanced-level programming assignments are an integral part of the course.

Students gain hands-on experience with data structures such as:
- Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, and Circular)
- Stacks and Queues
- Trees (Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees)
- Graphs and Hash Tables

The course also covers key algorithms for:
- Searching and Sorting
- Recursion
- Graph traversal (e.g., Dijkstra's algorithm)
- Tree balancing and traversal

## Skills and Learning Outcomes
By the end of the course, students will be able to:
- Implement and manipulate core data structures in Java.
- Analyze the time and space complexity of algorithms using Big-O notation.
- Develop modular programs using object-oriented design principles.
- Write and run unit tests using JUnit to verify program correctness.
- Apply abstract data types (ADTs) to solve real-world computational problems.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Java 23+**
- **JUnit 4/5** (for unit testing)
- **Eclipse IDE** or IntelliJ IDEA 
- **Git/GitHub** for version control

## Prerequisites
- CMSC 203 (Computer SCience I)

## Instructor Note
Projects in this course are designed to simulate real-world programming tasks that emphasize correctness, efficiency, and maintainability. Proper documentation, test coverage, and code style are expected.
